In twilight's hush, where shadows play,
The forest stirs, and night awakes.
The trees stand tall, their branches wide,
A canopy of green, side by side.

The wind whispers secrets, low and sweet,
Through leaves that rustle, soft and neat.
The earthy scent, a fragrance rare,
Fills lungs with joy, without a care.

In crystal streams, the water sings,
A melodic whisper, heartbeats brings.
The sun's last rays, upon its face,
Illuminate, in a warm, golden space.

The stars appear, like diamonds bright,
Twinkling in the velvet night.
The moon, a glowing orb of white,
Casts shadows deep, in the forest's light.

In this world of wonder, we find our peace,
A connection to nature's release.
So let us breathe, and listen too,
To the whispers of the natural "you".

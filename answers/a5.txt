In twilight's hush, where shadows play,
The forest whispers secrets of the day.
The trees, like sentinels of old,
Stand guard, their branches stretching gold.

The wind stirs leaves, a rustling sound,
As nature awakens, all around.
The sun's warm touch, it gently plays,
Upon the earth, in radiant ways.

In crystal streams, they dance and play,
Reflecting sunbeams, in shimmering gray.
The water's edge, a peaceful sight,
A haven for the fish, in morning light.

The forest floor, a carpet deep,
With ferns and moss, a verdant sleep.
The trees' leaves rustle, a gentle hush,
As nature's symphony, forever rush.

In mountain peaks, where snow does lie,
The wildflowers bloom, in vibrant sigh.
Their colors bright, like jewels rare,
A treasure trove, beyond compare.

Nature's beauty, it forever reigns,
A treasure to behold, in endless plains.
Her wisdom, ancient, yet so true,
A gift to us, from the heart anew.

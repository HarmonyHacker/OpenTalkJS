Title: "The Impact of Climate Change on Crop Yields and Water Usage in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Comparative Study of Smallholder Farmers"

Abstract:

Climate change is projected to have devastating impacts on agricultural productivity, food security, and livelihoods in sub-Saharan Africa. This study investigates the effects of climate variability and extreme weather events on crop yields and water usage in smallholder farming households across five countries (Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, Rwanda, and Tanzania). We employed a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative data from focus groups and interviews with quantitative analysis of satellite imagery and climate models. Our results show that:

* Climate-related shocks to agricultural productivity increase by 25% per year in sub-Saharan Africa.
* Water usage patterns are highly correlated with crop yields, particularly for maize and beans.
* Smallholder farmers are disproportionately vulnerable to climate-related risks due to limited access to credit, insurance, and technology.

Our findings highlight the need for policymakers, researchers, and practitioners to develop effective strategies to support smallholder farmers in managing climate-related stressors. We propose a multi-stakeholder approach that incorporates climate-smart agriculture practices, such as agroforestry, conservation agriculture, and precision irrigation. Our results have implications for regional development planning, agricultural policy, and poverty reduction efforts in sub-Saharan Africa.
